## CS420-artificial-intelligence (Assignment Description)

This repository contains my course works for CS420 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

The first 3 questions of Assignement 1 focus on the concept of conditional independence in Bayesian Network and its real life application. For question 4, I created an artificial neural-based classifier to classify the k_mnist dataset which is available [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/kmnist) (more details about the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist)). The ultimate goal of this task is to achieve an overall accuracy of >80% and have a thorough understanding of how a dense artificial neural network (ANN) works. For question 5, I learned how to perform transfer learning in the context of convolutional neural network (CNN). A pre-trained model called "MobileNetV2" is used to execute image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (more information on the dataset is available [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)). The goal is to design an CNN that achieve >85% accuracy on overall.

Main python packages used in this Assignment 1:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV

The first 2 questions focus on heuristics-based learning, whereas question 3 focus on the fundamental concepts of Markov Decision Problem. For question 4, I installed OpenAI gym, and implemented Q-learning for FrozenLake environment. For question 5, I employed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain word embeddings and compare the generated word embeddings with the word embeddings generated using word2vec. The corpus to be considered is a set of documents from the Reuters dataset, a benchmark dataset for several text mining tasks. The main goal for this task is to make comparisons on word embeddings created using SVD and WordToVec methods, i.e., understand the fundamentals and general concepts of NLP.
